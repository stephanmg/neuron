Building linux with rtai
see http://www.fdn.fr/~brouchou/rtai/rtai-doc-prj/installation-guide.html
also extremely helpful, especially for the initial transformation of
neuron was: http://people.mech.kuleuven.be/~psoetens/portingtolxrt.html

using
rtai-3.2
linux-2.6.10
patched with rtai-3.2/base/arch/i386/patches/hal-linux-2.6.10-i386-r9.patch

cp /boot/config-2.6.12-1.1372_FC3 .config
make oldconfig #accept default for everything
make gconfig
General setup
	LOCALVERSION -adeos
Loadable module support
	Enable loadable module support
	`	MODVERSIONS N
Power management options
	Power Management support PM (I left it on but ...)
Processor type and features
	REGPARM N (Y prevents testsuites/user tests from working)

make
su
make modules_install
make install

I've been uninstalling my failures by removing /boot/*2.6.10*
/lib/modules/2.6.10*
and editing /boot/grub/grub.conf

I'm not quite sure, but after the linux config is built and even before
building, installing, and rebooting, I think it might be a good idea
to configure rtai-3.2
I created $HOME/rtlinux/rtaibuild and did
make -f ../rtai-3.2/makefile srctree=../rtai-3.2 gconfig
General
	Installation directory /home/hines/rtlinux/realtime
	Linux source tree /home/hines/rtlinux/linux-2.6.10
    Machine
	Number of CPUs 1 (my guess, I am not sure)
      IPC support
	I turned on Yes for Semaphores, Message, and Mailboxes.
	I'm not sure if that was necessary, but I do not know what
	M (Maybe?) means
at any rate, after that, configure succeeded.

Also it is not clear to me that it is necessary to reboot linux before
building rtai but I generally have rebooted first and then in rtaibuild
make
su
make install

moved the realtime/lib files out of the way except for liblxrt.a to avoid
some link warnings.

One then tests with

copy a tests .runinfo and run to a test directory and modify the
.runinfo to read
